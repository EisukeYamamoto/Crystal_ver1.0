## Overview of this game
Collect the materia while protecting the large crystal in the middle of the stage from enemies!
Enemies will be advancing from outside the stage, aiming at the crystals all at once.
Use the main character's cannon to scatter the enemies, and carry all the materia scattered across the stage within the time limit!
For more information, try playing the in-game tutorial.
The use of the mouse is recommended for this game.
